# ü•§ Python Vending Machine Simulator

This project is a simulation of a beverage vending machine developed in Python, created as part of the **Algorithmic Reasoning** course. The program allows a user to select a drink, pay (including partial payments), and receive change, updating the stock in real-time.

## üöÄ Features

- Display current drink inventory with quantities and prices
- Validate drink selection by ID
- Handle partial payments, requesting additional money until the total price is met
- Calculate and display change, including a detailed breakdown of bills and coins
- Update stock quantity after each successful transaction
- Modular and readable code structure with clear functions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3** as the programming language
- Built-in modules:
  - `random` for generating random values in some auxiliary functions (e.g., generating change or test cases)
- Core concepts:
  - Lists of dictionaries for drink inventory management
  - Loops (`while` and `for`) for repetitive operations
  - Conditional statements for selection logic
  - Functions for modular and maintainable code
  - Input/output for user interaction

## üìÇ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PedroMagno07/python-vending-machine.git
   cd python-vending-machine
